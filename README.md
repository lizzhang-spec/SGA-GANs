# SGA-GANs
Multi-Optimiser Training for GANs based on Evolutionary Computation.

# Descriptions
The codes provided above are only for BEGAN. For the other four models—GAN, DCGAN, WGAN, and WGAN-GP—we implemented them based on [this repository](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN)

# Descriptions
Run search.py first, then train.py
